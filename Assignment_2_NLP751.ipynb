        "# Step 7: Final Insights & Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "Binary classification results show that using LDA topic modeling vectors achieves an average of 87% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In contrast, the models built with advanced word embeddings (GloVe) reach about 88% on all these metrics. Although the difference is slight, it suggests that the richer semantic information captured by embeddings gives a modest performance edge over the thematic features provided by LDA. This indicates that both approaches are effective for binary text classification, with embeddings slightly outperforming LDA in capturing nuanced relationships in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Using a smaller dataset to test coherence score could reduce computation time\n",
        "*   Advanced Methods like BERT or combining LDA topics with embeddings could further enhance performance\n",
        "*   Further hyperparameter tuning and data diversity could also improve model generalization (increasing data size)\n",
        "*   Opting to use deep-learning models like Autoencoders can be a better place to start in replacement of LDA topic modelling.\n",
        "*   Building upon Autoencoders, we could also use a tensorflow deep-learning neural network model as a binary classifier such as tf.keras.Sequential. This would also be robust to outliers and prioritize relevant relationships more highly.\n",
        "*   Removal of excessively long words. There are some words that weren't cleaned out as the code was too complex for the Google Colab runtime.\n",
        "*   Similarly, Spellchecker should've been used on the data to aid data density and align more words with one another to improve output. However, all attempted spellcheckers, even while using chunking extensively, were crashing the Google Colab runtime."
